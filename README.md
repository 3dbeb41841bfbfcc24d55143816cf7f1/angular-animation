### Preparation
- Create a basic Angular app
- Be awesome at CSS
- Explain the use case for CSS classes

## CSS Classes in Angular - Intro (5 mins)

Today we'll be learning two things that are fun, light, and extremely useful.

First, Angular is a super dynamic front-end framework, and one of the things you'll do _most_ often when building a frontend is apply CSS classes to style elements on the page. Having the ability to change those styles based on _data_ is really powerful and can enable you to make some really dynamic interface designs. You certainly have the skills to do this with plain-old logic, but Angular gives us a tool built for this purpose – **ngClass**.

Second, we're going to play add some subtle animation to our style with CSS transitions. Little things like that can really boost the credibility of your design – _if_ you use it well. But you certainly can't use it well if you don't know how to use it at all so let's check it out today.

## Starter Code - Intro (5 mins)

Now, go check out the starter code and see what we're working with. We've built a pretty basic Angular app using stuff you've mostly already seen.

Take a few minutes and browse through the code that's there and investigate how it works and what it's doing.

## ngClass - Codealong (10 mins)

`ngClass` is a pretty simple directive. There are a couple of possible ways to use it, but either way, it just needs a `true` or a `false` to decide if it should apply a class or remove it.

As you can imagine, `ngClass` can be applied to any HTML tag. If it can handle normal classes, it can handle `ngClass`. But keep in mind, `ngClass` is designed for adding/removing classes, so if you don't expect the classes to change, just use normal `class='something'`.

Now let's give this a shot: Like in our finished example, we want to apply a class of `error` – we've already got a style for that that will make the borders red so it's obvious something's wrong.

We need a true/false statement that will tell us if it's an "error" or not. For simplicity's sake, let's say that our only validation is whether the text of the input is four or more characters. The number's arbitrary but a good example.

We've got this:

```html
<input type="text" id="new-winner-name" ng-model="awards.newWinner.name" ... >
```

Adding `ngClass` is as easy as:

```html
<input type="text" id="new-winner-name" ng-model="awards.newWinner.name" ng-class="{'error': awards.newWinner.name.length <= 4}" ... >
```

Let's pull that out:
```js
ng-class="{'error': awards.newWinner.name.length <= 4}"
```

`ng-class` is just an attribute we add, a directive like we've seen before. In the quotes is a javascript object, where the key is the class name and the value is an expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.

This could _easily_ be a property on an object. In this example it's an expression. Let your imagination be your guide, but when run it reads like:

```js
{'error': true}
```

And by using a JS object in here, it's _easy_ to have multiple classes that get turned on/off via multiple dynamic booleans.

```js
{'error': true, 'wombat': false, 'super': true, 'so-cool': true}
```

Would equate to:

```html
<input ... class="error super so-cool" ... >
```

## ngClass - Independent Practice (10 mins)

Now, go crazy. You have 10 minutes - start experimenting with your own `ngClass` expressions:

- Add booleans as properties of your objects and try `ngClass` in our `ngRepeat`
- Make a checkbox with a class directly on it that toggles something on/off
- Make some changeable data in one part of the interface change the class & style in a totally separate part of the interface
- Try using an `ngClick` to toggle an arbitrary piece of data that affects multiple pieces of the interface at once

Play with it and you'll start seeing how powerful it is. Let's see what you come up with!

## CSS Transitions - Intro (10 mins)

Now that we've got that down, let's talk about our other sweet trick – animation in CSS.

There are two kinds of animation: **transitions** and **keyframe animations**.

They both result in styles changing over time, and both don't give you any extra styling – you can only animate CSS properties that already exist.

**Transitions** are generally used as a reaction to an interaction - something that changes when you hover or focus or click.

**Animations** have the ability to be more complicated, you can define them more precisely, and they're more flexible. They're also more code and still have to be triggered.

It's worth noting that just like visual design, animation is an art. Not in a wishy-washy modern art kind of way, but in that it's easy to make it look ugly if you don't pay attention to the subtleties. If you really like using animation, take some time to research the basic animation principles and animating for interfaces. You'll be glad you did.

> **Important note:** Not all transitions or animations work on css-generated pseudo-elements. :before and :after work in some browsers, but not all, so test and make sure it works before assuming it will.

## CSS Transition Demo (10 minutes)

Let's start with transitions - you'll see that those are pretty simple to get started with.

Let's say, for example, when we hover over our form, it rights itself and moves a little bit:

![animated form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25366/9594904/8ba3527c-5016-11e5-94a5-f8affb95ffba.gif)

We can inspect our form to see how it's rotated and positioned as it is:

```css
form {
  /* ... */

  -ms-transform: rotate(-7deg); /* IE 9 */
  -webkit-transform: rotate(-7deg); /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
  transform: rotate(-7deg);

  position: relative;
  left:-1rem;
  top: 0rem;
}
```

That's easy. Let's just modify those rotations and positions, something like:

```css
form:hover {
  top: -0.618rem;
  left: -0.382rem;
  -ms-transform: rotate(-2deg);
  -webkit-transform: rotate(-2deg);
  transform: rotate(-2deg);
}
```

Now the fun part:

```css
form {
  /* ... */
  transition: all 300ms ease-in-out;
}
```

The `all` lets you specify which CSS properties you want affected. You could list them out or cheat like we did there; the `300ms` says the transition should last that long, in milliseconds (or seconds); and the `ease-in-out` is one of a few choices that you can research to allow for _easing_, so the animation looks less robotic.

## CSS Animation Demo (10 minutes)

Now before we try it ourselves, let's see an animation. Animations can be triggered, remember, and by default, are triggered when an object appears (or when a class is applied) to an object.

But first, we have to _define_ an animation with keyframes. Imagine a timeline where you're saying "At this spot, do this. At this next spot, change that. At this other spot, it should look like this."

We do that by creating a special `@keyframes` rule, and just like a function in JS, we name it whatever we like:

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  80% {
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

Of course, nearly any properties can be changed and nearly any percentages can be included. You could have 100 keyframes if you want or just two.

But now that we've got a defined animation, we need to use it:

```css
ol li {
  animation-duration: 800ms;
  animation-name: fadeIn;
}
```

Just like a JS function (or better, a custom font declaration), we just reference the name we invented.

**Try refreshing the page** – see how it now fades in? **Try adding a name.** See how it fades?

## CSS Transition & Animation Independent Practice (10 minutes)

Now that we've seen two simple examples, try messing around. Add different keyframes and animate different properties. Use transitions over hover on other elements and see what CSS properties you can subtly animate.

There are a lot of CSS properties to play with and a lot of possibilities.  For instance:

- Change font weight or color when you hover over a winner
- Trying changing both opacity and color when fading in
- How could you make something fade _out_?
- Most importantly – **what simple animations could you add to help guide a user to know what to do with this page?** How could you use animation to show them how the interface works?

## Conclusion (5 mins)
- What's the difference between CSS transitions and animations? Where might you use one or the other?
- How do you write an `ngClass` with multiple CSS classes?
- When do you use `ngClass` vs. normal classes?
